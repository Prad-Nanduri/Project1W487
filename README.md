CMPSC 487W Project 1


This is my Project for the 487WProject 1 SUN Lab Security System.

- My project code implements all the functions that the project asks for.
- Due to some unidentified errors that were unable to be resolved and debugged, the program does not run properly.
- My code clearly shows all the functions, methods, classes, and constructors that are used in the functionality.
- I am unsure if the database is connected to the server or not but I have loaded and updated values in the SQLserver. This
is due to my inability to know if my database name and root url have been entered properly or not in the DatabaseConnection Class.
- Overall, my code is serious enough. If I would be able to resolve the few minor errors thrown by the project by sitting with a TA, I would definitely be able to show that all my operations are functionable with the code I wrote.
